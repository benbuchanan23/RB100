# Runaway Loop


loop do
  puts 'Just keep printing...'
  break
end


#Stopping a loop is as simple as adding the reserved word break 
# inside the loop. break is nearly always necessary when using loop 
# and doesn't require any conditions. When loop executes a break, it 
# stops iterating immediately and exits the block.
