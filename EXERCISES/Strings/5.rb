# Combining Names
  # Using the following code, combine the two names together to form a full name and assign that value to a variable named full_name. Then, print the value of full_name.

  # Expected output: John Doe

first_name = 'John' 
last_name = 'Doe' 

# String Interpolation Method
full_name = "#{first_name } #{last_name}" 
puts full_name

# String Concatenation Method
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
puts full_name
