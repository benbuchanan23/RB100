# Tricky Formatting
  # Using the following code, capitalize the value of state then print the modified value. Note that state should have the modified value both before and after you print it.

  # Expected output: Texas

state = 'tExAs' 

puts state.capitalize!


# ***** Use of .capitalize! *******
